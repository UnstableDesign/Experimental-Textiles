# Final Project: Adapt to Application

Taking what you have learned from your midterm and the weeklies to adapt your midterm swatch into a finished prototype. What separates this from the swatch your presented in the midterm is that it should be integrated into a form \(with all necessary components\) and exist as part of an interactive narrative. The objects do not need to be user interfaces, but they should somehow respond to the body and/or environment. 

Requirements: 

* You must replicate your swatch and fully integrate it into the textile of your final prototype. 
* Your application MUST include the use of at least one of the following: plying, braiding, knitting, weaving, felting.
* Your final prototype must take a soft form: wearable, interior object, soft architecture, soft sculpture, art object, robotic object, etc. 
* You must include as many soft components as possible. 
* Be thoughtful in your execution and design - form and function are both important here.

### Deliverable 1: One on One Planning Meeting with Professors

We will hold 10 minute meetings with each student during class on 11/2 and 11/9 to discuss their final concept and provide any additional direction and resources. These meetings will take place during class and we will distribute a sign up form via Canvas. 

### Deliverable 2: Concept Presentation

Create a 3 minute presentation about your final concept emphasizing the look and feel, the functionality, and the techniques you will be employing. You will be presenting these concepts for feedback from guests with expertise in smart textiles across engineering and art. The goal of the presentation is to learn how to refine your idea and/or avenues for the concept beyond the class. The guest experts are: [Anette Millington](https://www.anettemillington.com/), [Katya Arquilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katya-arquilla-797026101)_,_ [Alex Olwal](http://www.olwal.com/)\*

### Deliverable 3: Final Prototype Documentation

Document your final including a video of the object, photos that demonstrate its form and functionality, and diagrams describing its construction. Please prepare these webpages that the instructors can embed and share in a collection of class projects. More details to follow. 

### Deliverable 4: Final Project Presentation and Critique

Create a 5-minute presentation that describes your concept, the techniques employed, and the way in which the object functions \(e.g. as an art object, wearable, robotic thing, etc.\). Guest experts will be critiquing your project. More details to follow. The guest experts are:  [Annet Couwenberg](http://www.annetcouwenberg.com/), [Madison Maxey](https://www.instructables.com/member/MaddyMaxey/),  [Alex Olwal](http://www.olwal.com/)\*
