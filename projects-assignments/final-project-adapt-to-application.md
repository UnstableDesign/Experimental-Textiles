# Final Project: Adapt to Application

Taking what you have learned from your midterm and the weeklies to adapt your midterm swatch into a finished prototype. What separates this from the swatch your presented in the midterm is that it should be integrated into a form \(with all necessary components\) and exist as part of an interactive narrative. The objects do not need to be user interfaces, but they should somehow respond to the body and/or environment. 

Requirements: 

* You must replicate your swatch and fully integrate it into the textile of your final prototype. 
* Your application MUST include the use of at least one of the following: plying, braiding, knitting, weaving, felting.
* Your final prototype must take a soft form: wearable, interior object, soft architecture, soft sculpture, art object, robotic object, etc. 
* You must include as many soft components as possible. 
* Be thoughtful in your execution and design - form and function are both important here.
