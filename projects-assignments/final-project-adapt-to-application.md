# Final Project: Adapt to Application

**Taking what you have learned from the Integration modules \(Routing + Connecting\), adapt your swatch from the midterm into a finished prototype. You must replicate your swatch and fully integrate it into the textile of your final prototype. Your final prototype can take any soft form: wearable, interior object, soft architecture, soft sculpture, art object, robotic object, etc. Try to have as many soft components as possible. Be thoughtful in your execution and design.**

**Below are a list of people/projects that give you a sense of what final projects could look like:**
