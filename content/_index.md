title: Experimental Textiles - Fall 2022

# Experimental Textiles
A textile describes any material made from fiber (which is any material with a high length with width ratio). While textiles are ubiquitous in our daily interactions, forming the basis of clothing and upholstery as well as communications cables, agricultural scaffolds and composites, interaction designs and engineers have not deeply explored their possibilities for interactive applications. 

This course is intended to shed light on how textiles can be used to create functional systems and engineered for highly specific purposes. The goal is to encourage students outside of textiles to consider how they might integrate textile structures into their research and prototyping practice, or, for textiles experienced students to learn how their knowledges can be useful for producing new kinds of sensors, actuators, and otherwise "dynamic" textile systems. 

This semester will focus deeply on weaving with a deep look at the possibilities of woven structure as well as the ways in which structures can be designed and fabricated using many materials. This is a very central focus of Prof. Devendorf's Unstable Design Lab and we will invite students to investigate it alongside of our ongoing research.

## After Taking This Course
Students will be able to: 
- Weave on both Rigid Heddle and Floor Looms
- Design Custom Woven Structures to Suit Functional Requirements
- Have a Broad Knowledge of Textile Techniques and their uses Through History
- Have a Broad Knowledge of Textile Materials and their Functional Properties. 
- Create electronic circuits integrated into textiles, at the yarn-level.
- Gain insight into the state of the art in textile structure design from leading experts. 


## Resources and References
The following resources and references can be helpful for motivating the course and how the knowledge can be applied. Any of these texts that are assigned for reading during the semester will be available via canvas.
