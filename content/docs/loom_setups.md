Shared looms for this class will be housed in 1B25. You will have access to this room via your BuffOne card. 


# Loom Types

8S-1: An 8-Shaft Table Top Shaft Loom
8S-2: An 8-Shaft Table Top Shaft Loom
BabyWolf: An 8-Shaft Floor Loom


# Student Limits
The class looms are warped with enough yarn to support each student making 3.5 yards of cloth total. Technically, we warp assuming each student will weave 4 yards to account for waste when cutting. Please do not go over your 3.5 limit. With 22 students, 3.5 yards each comes to roughly 77 yards of cloth!


# Warping Details (for Prof. Devendorf's Records)
Initially, each loom will be warped with 15 yards of warp. We will wind 3 extra beams at 15 yards to swap in and tie on when the warp gets low. This will also help us adjust if one loom is used more/less than another. 

## Yarns

Each loom is warped with 8/4 cotton yarn. The warps alternate between colors black and flax. The weaving width will be 4". That means, each warp-set will require 720 yards (15 yards @ 12 epi * 4"). Because the colors will alternate 360 yards of each color are used per warp group. 

I am going to be winding the warp using a paddle: 

I have 9 cones of yarn: 
4 in Flax
5 in Black

Each cone has ~840 yds. I'll thread by paddle 12 warps wide. That means that each cone needs to supports 1 warp per inch, for 15 yds. There are going to be 4" width and 6 warp sets total, so we need 15yds * 4" * 6 warp-sets = 360yds  on each cone. If I split 2 of the flax cones, and one of black cones I will have 6 black and 6 flax cones, each with enough to support 6 full warps (+ a bit left over).
