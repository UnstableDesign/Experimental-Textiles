# Lesson Plan

**What to Bring**

Each day in class bring Scissors, Multimeter, Masking Tape, Pencil, Folder for Paper and Samples. Also have your loom (or whatever weaving accessories you need for the day)



---
## Week 1 - Welcome
The goals for this week are to help you gain an embodied sense of what weaving is, what a (string) heddle is and how it can help scaffold a tabby structure. We'll also do the administrative work of getting class setup.
