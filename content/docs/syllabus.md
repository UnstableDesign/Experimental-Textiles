### Online Instruction Values and Commitments  as described by the class on the first day\*

#### Be Present: 

being present was seen to mean having your camera on, not getting distracted by your phone \(putting it in another room if needed\), being responsive within the Zoom chat window. 

#### Lets Stay Together:

we agreed that staying together was building communication and community through shared spaces. In response, [we set up a slack channel for the class](https://app.slack.com/client/T0197GVSCKY/C018ZGHGDQX). We also agreed that we would all need to bring some vulnerability to the group, sharing our successes as well as the things we are struggling with. The space should be a kind space to listen and provide support to each other. 

#### Differences of Opinion:

we agreed that we need to be respectful and empathetic when listening to and responding to each other. A "yes, and...." strategy should be used when providing feedback. We also recognize that perception is different for everyone and we come from different lenses and experiences. 

#### Everyone Belongs: 

we interpreted this to mean that we should be interested in put in effort to the work in the class; that everyone is learning \(and ought to be learning given the unfamiliar-ness of the space\). We should attempt to treat others equally regardless of background, skills or knowledge. We should also build each other up when at all possible. 

#### Step Up, Step Back:

we agreed that we should be reflective  of how much "space" we are taking in the class and step up if we have a relevant experience or expertise. Laura noted that self-evaluations of expertise vary social category and encouraged us to be generous with our own evaluations of our expertise and offer up what we know. Be wanted to create a space where we could take risks exploring something we don't know well \(textiles or otherwise\). We acknowledged that the willingness to step up tends to come from a position of privilege and how that becomes present in the classroom. Ask yourself how you can swing privilege to make space for others. 

#### Privacy

we agreed that activities and narratives of what happens in class should stay in class because we need to build a culture of trust to ensure that each of us feels ok being vulnerable about the things we are thinking and making \(acknowledging that a creative practice is rooted in vulnerability and not-knowing\). Our work may be personal and each of us, via Zoom, can see into a slice of everyone else's' personal life, we can keep the personal things we learn about people to ourselves.  -->



## Course Schedule

You may view a detailed course schedule [on the Lesson Plan link](../lesson-plan)


## Course Materials 
You may view a detailed list of the materials that will be required for you to purchase or available for you to check out on the [Materials List](../material-list)


### Prototyping Materials
All students will be given access to a materials kit that they can use for their projects this semester. Depending on where each interest and process progresses, the Instructors may be able to lend you additional equipment and resources. 

Documentation will be a critical part of the class, so you may want to invest in a tri-pod or stationary mount for your smart phone or other camera, a macro lens \(for your phone or other camera\), and a quality set of lighting for photography. If you are having trouble obtaining these items, let the instructors know and we can help you.    

### Reading Materials
All reading materials for the course will be provided by the instructors via online resources or canvas links.

## Grading Rubric ##
All assignments will be turned in and graded in Canvas.

| Assignment Type | Percentage of Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| Weeklies | 45% |
| Final Project | 35% |
| Participation | 20% |

## Assignment Types ##

### Weeklies ### 

Weeklies are weekly assignments that consist of prompts for you to explore the course topic of the week. We ask each student to document their progress of investigation and submit it for grading using a template we will provide. Because we understand that your schedules can be challenging at times, I will waive your 2 lowest scoring weeklies. 

### Final ###

Your final project will consist of a material inquiry using weaving to invent a new technique, explore a historic technique, develop a new type of sensor or actuator, or a new technique and process of generating weaving.

### Participation ###

Because this is a small class that is very much centered on material experience, participation will be measured by your involvement in lectures. We expect all students to be actively engaged in discussions and/or show and tells. 

### Attendance ###
All students will have 2 absences excused automatically. Any additional absences and make up points will need to be coordinated with the instructor.  


## Research Activities ##
This course has been developed as part of a larger grant studying smart textiles collaboration. In week two, the instructor or one of her students will describe how research will take place in the class and give you the opportunity to opt into or out of those research activities. Your participation in the research activities will have no effects on your grade.   

## Contacting Prof. Devendorf ##
I  prefer that students utilize my office hours (link coming soon) with questions or comments about the class. Please send all email inquiries to laura.devendorf@colorado.edu. Please also put “\[**ExTx**\]” in the subject line so that I can easily recognize and respond to your email. I will do my best to respond to emails within one “business” day. For instance, if your message is sent during a regular school day \(weekday/non-holiday\), I will do my best to get back to you by the next regular school day. Due to my parenting duties, I check my email infrequently in the evenings and weekends. If you email me the night before an assignment is due, I am unlikely to be able to respond in time.

## Additional Policies

### Classroom Behavior ###
Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy.  For more information, see the [classroom behavior policy](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) and the [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/).



### Requirements for COVID-19 ###
As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU Boulder community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department and building requirements and all public health orders in place to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder currently requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty, staff and students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of vaccination and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical, ethical or moral grounds through the MyCUHealth portal.

The CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms, students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution. For more information, see the policy on classroom behavior and the Student Code of Conduct. If you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the steps in the “Accommodation for Disabilities” statement on this syllabus.

If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (contacttracing@colorado.edu). If you are fully vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for symptoms and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (contacttracing@colorado.edu). As in the case of any illness, please notify your instructor if you will not be attending class with an estimation of how long you may be gone to request extensions to upcoming deadlines. Not all deadlines will be able to be extended, and in this case, we will determine an alterative plan for the assignment submissions. 


### Accommodation for Disabilities

  
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the Disability Services website. Contact [Disability Services website](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students) at 303-492-8671 or dsinfo@colorado.edu  for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions) on the Disability Services website.

### Preferred Student Names and Pronouns
CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name.


### Honor Code

All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code \(honor@colorado.edu\); 303-492-5550\). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the [Honor Code Office website](https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code).

### Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation

The University of Colorado Boulder \(CU Boulder\) is committed to fostering a positive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct intimate partner abuse \(including dating or domestic violence\), stalking, protected-class discrimination or harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance \(OIEC\) at 303-492-2127 or cureport@colorado.edu. Information about the OIEC, university policies, [anonymous reporting](https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PnqVK4kkIJIZnf), and the campus resources can be found on the [OIEC website](http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/).

Please know that faculty and instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about options for reporting and support resources.

### Religious Holidays

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance.  Please contact me via email or office hours by the end of the second week of the course with specific dates that present conflicts so that I have an opportunity to make systemic adjustments to the course requirements that will benefit all students. See the [campus policy regarding religious observances](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams) for full details.
