# Material List

While most equipment required for the class will be provided, we are asking students to purchase a few materials on their own, as they are ones we expect some might already own. After the first half of the class, each student will refine their direction and may need access to more specific equipment and supplies. In that case, we have created a "library" for you to check out or take materials as they are required. The instructor will introduce which materials are available and how to access the materials library during the semester. 


<!-- ### How to Check Out from the Class Library

There is a locked cabinet on the first floor of ATLAS that will contain supplies that you welcome to take for the purposes of completing class projects \(no personal projects please\). We are using the honor system so please take only what you need, especially with materials that are limited in supply. Other items will need to be formally checked out \(and later returned\) from the instructor and we can coordinate those checkouts [**through this checkout form**](https://forms.gle/QtsD814CHaysVYbd7)**.**  -->

## Where to Shop Locally

We have provided links to places where you can order other essential or helpful materials. But there are also some local suppliers you can obtain more general textile supplies and equipment from: 

* [Art Parts](https://www.yelp.com/biz/art-parts-creative-reuse-center-boulder) is a local non-profits that we love and where we have obtained most materials for the course \(and at a discounted price\). They have an amazing selection of donated textile materials and equipments that you can purchase. Some of these materials are much higher quality than you would find at a craft retailer like Michaels or Joannes. 
* [Joanne's](https://stores.joann.com/co/boulder/) is located very close to campus and has general purpose textile supplies. 

## Essentials 

Essential materials are those **required to complete the course assignments**. We will either expect you to obtain these in the first week of class or will provide them to you during class. Items with an X in the "You" Column are those we expect you to provide. Those in the "Course" column will be provided to you through the distribution of the kit.

<!-- ## Materials and Equipment Available for Check Out

you may find it useful to have other materials accessible. These are products you may wish to purchase yourself or will be accessible \(on a first come first served bases\) through the course materials library. If you would like to get a better sense of the material and quantity, you can see all of the materials [in this shared photo library](https://photos.app.goo.gl/vKVDvacFFzdoT92RA). Amounts are difficult to specify exactly: 

* **Limited** means that not every student will be able to use the material, so it should be saved for projects that absolutely need it or taken in very small supplies; 
* **Enough** means that we probably have enough for everyone to have a bit, or for a few students to have a lot; 
* **Plenty** means everyone should be able to have some and that we should have more than we need for the semester.
