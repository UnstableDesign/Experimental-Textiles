# 6. Weave a Sensing Circuit

This week, you are going to implement a [Voltage Dividing Circuit](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers/all) within a woven textile. 

## Materials
| Item | Qty  | Location
| :--- | :--- | :-- |
| Silicon Coated Wire | 2 yds | kit
| (Optional) Statex Conductive Thread | 1 yard  | kit
| Seed Studio Board | 1 | you
| 4.7 kOhm Resistor | 1 | kit
| Photoresistor | 1 | kit
| LED | 3 | kit
| (optional) needle nose pliers | 1 | you
| Thread | 12" | you or in class
| Scissors | 1 | you
| Warped Cricket Loom | 1 | from weekly 3
| Weft Yarns | 10 yds | in class
| Connectors | 3 | from Weekly 2
| Multimeter | 1 | you


## Requirements
Your voltage dividing circuit will consist of a light sensor, a resistor, and an LED and should have conductive threads/wires that can connect to power, ground, and analog input on an Arduino. You must integrate the conductive wires (traces) while you are weaving. You can attach the resistors, LED, and light sensor afterward.

Bonus: consider how you might just use resistive yarn instead of a resistor, or, swap the light sensor with a different analog sensor, for example, a moisture or force sensor or a woven switch. 

## What To Document In Your Weekly
In your weekly, explore how you are going to route the wires so that they allow for easy connections; where you might integrate the light sensor and LED to bring interactivity to the swatch; how might you connect the hard components to the textile in a way that makes them decorative?  

## Turn In
Turn your documentation into Canvas. Cut and finish your swatches and bring them to class.
