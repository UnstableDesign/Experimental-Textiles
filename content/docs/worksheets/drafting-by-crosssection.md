# Drafting By Cross-Section

Drafting by cross-section allows you to think through the relationships between successive weft pics differently than the draft. It can also be helpful for planning and generating drafts from different layered cross sections. Here are some worksheets that can help you:

## Creating Cross-Sections for Single Layer structures
This can be useful for understanding how different pics will stack upon each other or how color effects might emerge.
