# Material List

This course requires the use of textile materials, some which are easily accessible and others that might require ordering. We will prepare kits for each student with a collection of materials that will be required to complete the course assignments. We will also ask students to buy some materials on their own \(as we think students may already own them or will use them for other classes\). 

## Essentials 

Essential materials are those required to complete the course assignments. We will either expect you to obtain these in the first week of class or will provide them to you in the form of a lab kit. Some items in your lab kit will be consumed and others we would like returned prior to Thanksgiving break.
