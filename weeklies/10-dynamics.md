# 10: Routing

Starting with the attachments you made in your last weekly \(on connections\) now route those connections to create a complete circuit using at least one of the following techniques:  
**plying, braiding, embroidery, knitting, weaving, felting.**   


Your circuit should include at least a battery and an LED \(or whatever hardware you will need when you “install” your final\). You may also include any additional components that you expect to need for your final \(e.g. microcontrollers, diodes, MOSFETs, etc.\).
