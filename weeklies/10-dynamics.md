# 10: Routing

Starting with the attachments you made in your last weekly \(on connections\) now route those connections to create a complete circuit using at least one of the following techniques: plying, braiding, knitting, weaving, felting. Your circuit should include at least a battery and an LED but you may also include any additional components that you expect to need for your final \(e.g. microcontrollers, diodes, MOSFETs, etc.\).
