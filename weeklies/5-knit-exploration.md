# 5. Knit Exploration

**Pick one area of knitting to explore: structure or tension. While knitting, you must incorporate 12in of conductive yarn. If you choose structure, explore different structures and combinations of structures, or create your own. Subvert the knitting structure. If you choose tension, play around with changing knitting needle size at random or calculated intervals to create a cloth with a specific or improvised surface tension. If you are already very familiar with knitting, create a swatch of your choice, incorporating 12in of conductive yarn. Your finished swatch should measure at least 3inx5in.**
