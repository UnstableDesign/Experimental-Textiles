# 3. String / Filament Explorations

**Pick one fiber, perhaps the fiber you worked with for the fiber exploration, and make a string/filament using some sort of spinning process. Question the idea of string/filament. Does it have to be spun or is there another way to make it? Create 12in of string.**
