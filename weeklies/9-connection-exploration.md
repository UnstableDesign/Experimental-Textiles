# 9: Connecting

Consider how you are going to integrate the component that you have made in the midterm into a larger circuit structure by experimenting with techniques for attaching wires/connectors to your component. Search for the technique that uses the most textile-based materials \(e.g. conducive yarn instead of wire, attachment via snaps as opposed to soldering\) and is the most feasible in terms of fabrication and connection. Attach at least 12" of a connecting material to each connection point \(e.g. power, ground, signal\), on your component.
