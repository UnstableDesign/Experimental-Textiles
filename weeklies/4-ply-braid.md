# 4. Ply / Braid Exploration

**Pick at least two strings of at least 12 inches. One must be conductive and one must be something you make from you kit materials, experiments from prior weeks, or otherwise.** 

**Ply or braid your strings together to make your own conductive yarn.** 

**Consider the properties you want your yarn to have. Is it continuously conductive or only in certain areas? Consider the properties of the other fiber\(s\) you are combining it with. Your finished ply/braid should measure 12in long.**
