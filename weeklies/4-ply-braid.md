# 4. Ply / Braid Exploration

**Pick at least two fibers. One must be conductive. Make at least two 12in long strings and ply or braid them together to make your own conductive yarn. Consider the properties you want your yarn to have. Is it continuously conductive or only in certain areas? Consider the properties of the other fiber\(s\) you are combining it with. Your finished ply/braid should measure 12in long.**
