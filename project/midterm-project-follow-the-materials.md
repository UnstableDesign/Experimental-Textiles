# Midterm Project: Follow the Materials

**Taking into consideration all of the ways you have learned to create a substrate, create a swatch for the course swatch book. Your substrate should function as some kind of sensor \(stretch, bend, force, etc\) or have a unique property \(changing shape, biodegradable, etc\). For your swatch book page, you must title your swatch and write a description of its function. You must include a list of the materials and tools used to create it. Depending on the function of your swatch, you can either include a technical circuit diagram or instructions for replicating your swatch. You must also include an illustrated diagram. The illustrated diagram should label all the parts of the swatch, how they function, and how it can be connected to. You must also cite at minimum two sources/references.** 

**Maximum swatch dimensions: 5.5" x 7.75" x 0.25"**
