## Instructors

**Laura Devendorf**  
Assistant Professor, ATLAS Institute & Dept. of Information Science  
laura.devendorf@colorado.edu  
Responsible for grading, participation and course administration.

**Sasha De Koninck**  
PhD student, Intermedia Art, Writing, and Performance

## Location and Timing 

In person location: ATLAS 113  
Zoom location: see Canvas

## Hybrid Instruction Details

Students will have the option to attend some in person sessions or take the course entirely online. In person sessions will be held particularly for class presentations and/or material demonstrations and will be limited in the amount of students depending on room size. In the event there are more students who wish to attend in person than the room can support, we will alternate in-person days between students \(half students for one week, half students the other\). The class has been designed to facilitate making and documenting in an entirely remote fashion. 

Online videos will take place at class time and will not be recorded for later viewing. 

## Course Description

This course will introduce students to techniques for designing and fabricating so-called "smart" textiles \(fabrics that have the components for sensing and actuation integrated into their structure\). With applications from soft robotics to medicine to fashion, the class will cover the state of the art from both engineering and art perspectives and will guide students through projects realizing their own interactive textile prototypes from design through fabrication. Students are encouraged to have completed basic electronics courses \(Object or experience programming and making projects with Arduino\) and while initial experience with textile fabrication is helpful, it is not required.   


### **Course Objectives:**

**Students who successfully complete this course will:**

* Understand the fundamental structures, processes, and dynamics for smart textiles. 
* Understand pattern languages for textiles and circuitry
* Learn how to use state of the art fiber-based "smart" materials
* Partake in a design methodology of materials-led research. 
* Learn a deeper sense of the gendered legacies of textiles innovation and its critical yet marginalized history in technical innovation.

## **Course Schedule**

**Weeks 1-8: Process // Substrate**  
The first eight weeks of the course will focus on textile "substrates" or particular structures, materials and techniques common to textile design and craft. We will guide you through a materials-led design process to discover new functionalities by combining textile structures, fibers such as wool and cotton, conductive materials and/or bio materials.  Your midterm will emerge from your weekly investigations in this first module and will consist of a swatch that demonstrates and refines a functionality you have discovered.   

**Week 8-15: Application // Integration**  
The last half of the course will be devoted to integrating your midterm swatch into an application. Here we will focus on how to embed your textile swatches into more complex forms and/or different circuitry structures. Your final will be a refined prototype that demonstrates this new application. 

We will meet at our assigned finals slot for a final critique. 

## Course Materials \(to be updated\)

### Prototyping Materials

All students will be given access to a materials kit that they can use for their projects this semester. Depending on where each interest and process progresses, the Instructors may be able to lend you additional equipment and resources. The course has been designed under the assumption that everyone can work remotely, but students may need to come to campus to obtain their materials.  

Documentation will be a critical part of the class, so you may want to invest in a tri-pod or stationary mount for your smart phone or other camera, a macro lens \(for your phone or other camera\), and a quality set of lighting for photography. If you are having trouble obtaining these items, let the instructors know and we can help you.    

### Reading Materials

All reading materials for the course will be provided by the instructors. With so many resources available on the internet, we are relying on students to begin from our resources but begin their own pathways of inquiry.  

## **Grading Rubric & Assignment Types**

| Assignment Type | Percentage of Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| Weeklies | 35% |
| Final Project | 25% |
| Midterm Project | 20% |
| History Of... | 5% |
| Participation | 15% |

**Weeklies** 

Weeklies are weekly assignments that consist of prompts for you to explore the course topic of the week. We ask each student to document their progress of investigation and submit it for grading using a template we will provide.   

**History Of**

This is a one time, 15 minute presentation  that you will give to the class to investigate the history of a particulate technique, structure, process or material that you choose. We will determine your assigned date and topic for this assignment in the second week of the semester.  ****

**Midterm** 

Your midterm will consist of developing and documenting a smart textile swatch. 

 **Final**

Your final project will consist of an application or object in which your midterm swatch is embedded. 

**Participation**

Because this is a small class, participation will be measured by your involvement in lectures \(in person and/or online\). We expect all students to attend any virtual classes with video's on and to be actively engaged in discussions and/or show and tells. 

**Attendance** 

All students will have 2 absences excused automatically. Any additional absences and make up points will need to be coordinated with the instructor. ****  


## **Research Activities**

This course has been developed as part of a larger grant studying smart textiles collaboration. In week two, the instructor or one of her students will describe how research will take place in the class and give you the opportunity to opt into or out of those research activities. Your participation in the research activities will have no effects on your grade.   

## **Contacting Prof. Devendorf**

I  prefer that students utilize my office hours with questions or comments about the class. Please send all email inquiries to laura.devendorf@colorado.edu. Please also put “\[**SO**\]” in the subject line so that I can easily recognize and respond to your email. I will do my best to respond to emails within one “business” day. For instance, if your message is sent during a regular school day \(weekday/non-holiday\), I will do my best to get back to you by the next regular school day. Due to my parenting duties, I check my email infrequently in the evenings and weekends. If you email me the night before an assignment is due, I am unlikely to be able to respond in time.

## **Additional Policies**
